# Organ-Donation-Dashboard
This project is an Organ Donation Dashboard, a web-based application designed to manage and display information related to organ donation. It provides a user-friendly interface for various functionalities, including user authentication and the presentation of key data.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Secure login.html and signup.html pages for user access.

Informational Pages: Dedicated sections like about.html, Contact.html, and Services.html to provide comprehensive information about organ donation.

Data Visualization/Management: The core Data.html page likely serves as the dashboard, presenting relevant organ donation statistics and management tools.

Languages Used:
The project primarily utilizes standard web technologies for its front-end development:

HTML: For structuring the content and pages.

CSS: For styling and ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

JavaScript: For interactive elements, dynamic content loading, and potentially handling client-side data manipulation.

Database Details:
Given the nature of a dashboard managing data, a database is essential for storing and retrieving information. While not explicitly stated in the provided file list, a typical setup for such a web application would involve:

Database System: A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, would be used to store user information, donor/recipient data, organ statistics, and other relevant details.

Backend Language (for database interaction): A server-side language such as Python (with frameworks like Flask/Django), Node.js (with Express), PHP, or Java (with Spring) would be used to handle requests from the front-end, interact with the database, and serve dynamic content.

Project Path:
The main entry point to the application is index.html. The primary dashboard interface is expected to be found at Data.html.
